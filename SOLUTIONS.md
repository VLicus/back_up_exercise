# Back up exercise

## Back up types


1. Full: The most basic and comprehensive backup method, where all data is sent to another location.

2. Incremental: Backs up all files that have changed since the last backup ocurred.

3. Differential: Backs up only copies of all files that have changed since the last full backup.

## CLI tools to perform back ups (full and incremental) and restores for the databases listed below:

1. MySQL

2. MongoDB

## Automate the back ups from section 2 using bash scripting (either MySQL or MongoDB).

## Schedule the scripts from section 3 using cron job to perform a full backup once a week and an incremental backup every day.
